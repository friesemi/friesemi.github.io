## Projects
### Personal Projects
1. LED Light Programming  
  This project entailed adding various lighting patterns and differing settings/presets to strands of programmable LED lights. The code was flashed on to an Arduino  
  that ran a pre-made source code to handle the setup of the lights. I was able to create several different light patterns and experiment with timings, movement, and  
  other aspects of the lights.
  
2. Magic Mirror  
  The Magic Mirror was a large, hand-made mirror with a one-way mirror that had a monitor mounted to the back controlled by a Raspberry Pi. A preset program was  
  loaded on to the Raspberry Pi that started the mirror and displayed a blank canvas, then several modules were added created in Bash to add various functions to the mirror,  
  such as the time of day, weather, calendar, daily quotes and many other types of modules. This gave me more experience with Bash and integrated systems like the Raspberry Pi.  
  
### School Projects
1. Where's My Stuff Inventory System  
  [Repo](https://github.com/friesemi/Where-s_My_Stuff)  
  This project is my senior capstone project and is in cooperation with two other team members. Our goal is to create an inventory management system that allows users   
  to add to and modify their various inventories of parts/tools/inventory using either text or voice commands. The project entails creating a MySql database to house  
  inventory items, a backend API application to query the database, a frontend application to show the results, and a voice processing software to handle voice commands.  
  
2. Dog Information Website  
  [Repo](https://github.com/friesemi/CS340FinalProject)  
  This project was created to utilize database creation and management abilities using a MySql database hosted with MariaDB. The project contains an html, handlebars,   
  and javascript-backed frontend application backed by a relational database that implments various CRUD queries and data management.
