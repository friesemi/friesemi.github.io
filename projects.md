  This project is my senior capstone project and is in cooperation with two other team members. Our goal is to create an inventory management system that allows users 
  to add to and modify their various inventories of parts/tools/inventory using either text or voice commands. The project entails creating a MySql database to house
  inventory items, a backend API application to query the database, a frontend application to show the results, and a voice processing software to handle voice commands.

## Personal Projects
### 1. LED Light Programming  
#### **Description**  
  This project entailed adding various lighting patterns and differing settings/presets to strands of programmable LED lights. The code was flashed on to an Arduino
  that ran a pre-made source code to handle the setup of the lights. I was able to create several different light patterns and experiment with timings, movement, and
  other aspects of the lights.  
#### **Technologies Used**  
  - Arduino IDE
  - Arduino board
  
### 2. Magic Mirror  
#### **Description**  
  The Magic Mirror was a large, hand-made mirror with a one-way mirror that had a monitor mounted to the back controlled by a Raspberry Pi. A preset program was
  loaded on to the Raspberry Pi that started the mirror and displayed a blank canvas, then several modules were added created in Bash to add various functions to the mirror,
  such as the time of day, weather, calendar, daily quotes and many other types of modules. This gave me more experience with Bash and integrated systems like the Raspberry Pi.  
#### **Technologies Used**  
- Raspberry Pi
- Bash scripts
