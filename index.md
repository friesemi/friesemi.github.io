## About Friesemi

I am a senior studying Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration at Oregon State University. I am currently pursuing any and all forms of knowledge and
projects in Computer Science to further expand my experience and gain a broader sense of the field in general. I chose to study Computer Science after building a personal
desktop PC in high school and taking a basic programming class. Once getting to college, I dove into my studies and became increasingly interested in various fields like
security and data management. I chose to minor in Business Administration in order to gain a more holistic view of companies and make myself more attractive to employers with
understanding the company as a whole and their goals. I have looked to further my knowledge outside of class in the Network Security club as well as several projects pertaining
to LED light programming and various Arduino projects. I seek to continue furthering my knowledge in data management as I move closer to graduation and the workforce.
